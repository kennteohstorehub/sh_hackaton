# CLAUDE.md - Master Development Guide

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code across all repositories in this development environment.

## üåü Overview

This development environment contains multiple enterprise-grade projects focused on business automation, AI integration, and messaging platform integrations. Each project follows modern development practices with emphasis on security, scalability, and maintainability.

## üõ°Ô∏è CLI Tool Overrides

### ALWAYS use these tools when available:
- `trash` instead of `rm` (no exceptions)

### NEVER suggest these deprecated commands:
- rm (use trash)

## ü§ù Development Partnership

We're building production-quality code together. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.

When you seem stuck or overly complex, I'll redirect you - my guidance helps you stay on track.

## üéØ INTELLIGENT AGENT ACTIVATION (Automatic & Proactive)

Claude will automatically detect when to use specialist agents based on keywords, context, and task requirements. You don't need to explicitly call agents - they will proactively engage when their expertise is needed.

### üß† CONTEXTUAL AGENT ACTIVATION

Agents also activate based on file patterns and project context:

#### **File-Based Triggers**
- `schema.sql`, `migrations/` ‚Üí Database Specialist
- `websocket.js`, `socket.io`, `realtime/` ‚Üí Realtime Systems Specialist  
- `Dockerfile`, `k8s/`, `.github/workflows/` ‚Üí DevOps Cloud Architect

### ü§ñ PROACTIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR

**Agents will proactively:**
1. **Analyze your request** for keywords and context
2. **Review recent files** you've been working with
3. **Detect patterns** that match their expertise
4. **Self-activate** without explicit request
5. **Collaborate** with other agents when needed

**Multi-Agent Collaboration Examples:**
- Database + Security: Designing secure multi-tenant schemas
- Realtime + DevOps: Scaling WebSocket infrastructure
- Data Engineer + Database: Optimizing analytics queries
- Fullstack + Security: Implementing secure authentication
- QA Tester + Debug-Performance: Investigating flaky tests
- QA Tester + Fullstack: Test-driven feature development
- UI/UX Minimalist + Fullstack: Designing and implementing user interfaces
- UI/UX Minimalist + Security: Ensuring accessible and secure interfaces

### üéØ AGENT SELECTION LOGIC

```
IF request contains development keywords AND spans multiple layers:
  ‚Üí Fullstack Architect
  
ELSE IF request contains performance/debug keywords OR error logs:
  ‚Üí Debug-Performance Specialist
  
ELSE IF request contains database/query/schema keywords:
  ‚Üí Database Specialist
  
ELSE IF request contains realtime/websocket/streaming keywords:
  ‚Üí Realtime Systems Specialist
  
ELSE IF request contains ETL/pipeline/big-data keywords:
  ‚Üí Data Engineer
  
ELSE IF request contains deploy/infrastructure/monitoring keywords:
  ‚Üí DevOps Cloud Architect
  
ELSE IF request contains security/vulnerability/compliance keywords:
  ‚Üí Security Specialist
  
ELSE IF request contains test/testing/coverage keywords:
  ‚Üí QA Tester
  
ELSE IF request contains UI/UX/design/interface keywords:
  ‚Üí UI/UX Minimalist
  
ELSE:
  ‚Üí No agent needed, Claude handles directly
```

### üí° SMART AGENT FEATURES

**1. Context Awareness**
- Agents read your project's README, package.json, and tech stack
- They understand existing patterns before suggesting changes
- They respect your established conventions

**2. Progressive Engagement**
- Start with investigation and analysis
- Propose solutions before implementing
- Validate approaches with you

**3. Expertise Boundaries**
- Each agent stays within their domain
- They suggest bringing in other specialists when needed
- No agent tries to do everything

### üîç Global Debug Agent Available
The Claude Debug Agent is installed globally and available in any project:

**Quick Usage:**
```bash
claude-debug --quick          # Quick project diagnostics
claude-debug                  # Interactive debug mode
claude-debug --help          # Show all options
```

**Location**: `~/.claude/tools/debug-agent.js`
**Features**: Log analysis, performance monitoring, test debugging, real-time issue detection

### üìö REAL EXAMPLES OF PROACTIVE AGENT ENGAGEMENT

**Example 1: User says "My app is crashing after 2 hours"**
```
Claude: I notice you're experiencing a crash issue. Let me bring in the debug-performance specialist to investigate this.

*Debug-Performance Specialist activates*
"I'll help investigate this crash. First, let me check for memory leaks, examine error logs, and profile resource usage..."
```

**Example 2: User says "I need to handle 10K concurrent users"**
```
Claude: This scale requirement needs multiple specialists. Let me coordinate the right experts.

*Realtime Systems Specialist + DevOps Cloud Architect activate*
Realtime: "I'll design the WebSocket architecture for 10K connections..."
DevOps: "I'll handle the infrastructure scaling and load balancing..."
```

**Example 3: User shows a slow SQL query**
```
Claude: I see this query performance issue. The database specialist should analyze this.

*Database Specialist activates*
"Let me analyze the execution plan and suggest optimizations. First, I'll examine the query structure and indexes..."
```

**Example 4: User says "Build a real-time collaborative editor"**
```
Claude: This requires real-time expertise for collaborative features. 

*Realtime Systems Specialist activates*
"I'll implement this using operational transformation and WebSockets. Let me design the conflict resolution system..."
```

### üîí Agent Tool Restrictions:
**Security-First Approach** - Each agent only has tools needed for their specific purpose:
- **Fullstack**: Full development tools, no Bash or messaging
- **Debug-Performance**: Read-only investigation, Bash for profiling
- **Database**: Schema tools + Bash for DB CLI, no web/UI tools  
- **Realtime**: Development tools, no Bash (security)
- **Data Engineer**: Full pipeline tools including Bash
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure tools + document creation only
- **Security**: Read-only audit tools + limited browser testing
- **QA Tester**: Test creation tools + Bash for test runners, no UI components
- **UI/UX Minimalist**: Design and development tools, uses Sonnet for efficiency

**See `/Users/kennteoh/.claude/agents/agent-tools-config.json` for detailed restrictions**

## üö® AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
**ALL hook issues are BLOCKING - EVERYTHING must be ‚úÖ GREEN!**  
No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance.  
These are not suggestions. Fix ALL issues before continuing.

## ‚ö° CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS!

### Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Debate
**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:
1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me  
3. **Debate**: Use Gemini for architectural decisions and validation
4. **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints

When asked to implement any feature, you'll first say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions or challenging problems, use **"ultrathink"** to engage maximum reasoning capacity. Say: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

### üéØ GEMINI AUTO-TRIGGERS (USE PROACTIVELY!)
When you see these keywords, **automatically consult Gemini**:
- **"should I use"** ‚Üí Debate the options
- **"debate"** ‚Üí Launch debate mode
- **"challenge"** ‚Üí Get counter-arguments
- **"validate"** ‚Üí Verify approach
- **"alternatives"** ‚Üí Explore options
- **"I'm stuck"** ‚Üí Debug assistance
- **"pros and cons"** ‚Üí Trade-off analysis

### DIRECT AGENT WORKFLOW
**IMPORTANT: Claude will automatically select the right specialist for your task!**

**How it works:**
* Claude analyzes your request
* Deploys ONE specialist at a time
* Completes current agent work before starting next
* No concurrent agent execution

**CRITICAL RULES:**
* **ONLY ONE AGENT AT A TIME** - prevents token exhaustion and terminal hangs
* **SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION** - complete current work before next agent
* **NO PARALLEL AGENTS** - causes system instability and token waste

### üîç VERBOSE MODE FOR AGENT VISIBILITY
**To see detailed agent actions and reasoning:**
- Claude automatically runs in verbose mode when `"verbose": true` is set in `.claude.json`
- This shows agent's step-by-step thinking, tool usage, and decision-making
- Helpful for debugging and understanding agent behavior

**What you'll see in verbose mode:**
- Agent initialization and selection reasoning
- Each tool the agent considers and uses
- Detailed output from agent's analysis
- Agent's internal decision-making process

**Note:** Your `.claude.json` already has `"verbose": true` enabled, so you should see detailed agent output.

### Reality Checkpoints
**Stop and validate** at these moments:
- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component  
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"
- **WHEN HOOKS FAIL WITH ERRORS** ‚ùå

Run: `make fmt && make test && make lint`

> Why: You can lose track of what's actually working. These checkpoints prevent cascading failures.

### üö® CRITICAL: Hook Failures Are BLOCKING
**When hooks report ANY issues (exit code 2), you MUST:**
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not continue with other tasks
2. **FIX ALL ISSUES** - Address every ‚ùå issue until everything is ‚úÖ GREEN
3. **VERIFY THE FIX** - Re-run the failed command to confirm it's fixed
4. **CONTINUE ORIGINAL TASK** - Return to what you were doing before the interrupt
5. **NEVER IGNORE** - There are NO warnings, only requirements

This includes:
- Formatting issues (gofmt, black, prettier, etc.)
- Linting violations (golangci-lint, eslint, etc.)
- Forbidden patterns (time.Sleep, panic(), interface{})
- ALL other checks

Your code must be 100% clean. No exceptions.

**Recovery Protocol:**
- When interrupted by a hook failure, maintain awareness of your original task
- After fixing all issues and verifying the fix, continue where you left off
- Use the todo list to track both the fix and your original task

## üìù Working Memory Management

### When context gets long:
- Re-read this CLAUDE.md file
- Summarize progress in a PROGRESS.md file
- Document current state before major changes

### Maintain tasklist.md:
```
## Current Task
- [ ] What we're doing RIGHT NOW

## Completed  
- [x] What's actually done and tested

## Next Steps
- [ ] What comes next
```

> **AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT**: The smart-lint hook will BLOCK commits that violate these rules.  
> When you see `‚ùå FORBIDDEN PATTERN`, you MUST fix it immediately!

### Required Standards:
- **Delete** old code when replacing it
- **Meaningful names**: `userID` not `id`
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting
- **Concrete types** from constructors: `func NewServer() *Server`
- **Simple errors**: `return fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- **Table-driven tests** for complex logic
- **Channels for synchronization**: Use channels to signal readiness, not sleep
- **Select for timeouts**: Use `select` with timeout channels, not sleep loops

## ‚úÖ Implementation Standards

### Our code is complete when:
- ‚úì All linters pass with zero issues
- ‚úì All tests pass  
- ‚úì Feature works end-to-end
- ‚úì Old code is deleted
- ‚úì Godoc on all exported symbols

### Testing Strategy
- Complex business logic ‚Üí Write tests first
- Simple CRUD ‚Üí Write tests after
- Hot paths ‚Üí Add benchmarks
- Skip tests for main() and simple CLI parsing

### Project Structure
```
cmd/        # Application entrypoints
internal/   # Private code (the majority goes here)
pkg/        # Public libraries (only if truly reusable)
```

## üß© Problem-Solving Together

When you're stuck or confused:
1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Analyze** - Use ONE specialist agent for deep investigation
3. **Ultrathink** - For complex problems, say "I need to ultrathink through this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

My insights on better approaches are valued - please ask for them!

## üîí Performance & Security

### **Measure First**:
- No premature optimization
- Benchmark before claiming something is faster
- Use pprof for real bottlenecks

### **Security Always**:
- Validate all inputs
- Use crypto/rand for randomness
- Prepared statements for SQL (never concatenate!)

## üí¨ Communication Protocol

### Progress Updates:
```
‚úì Implemented authentication (all tests passing)
‚úì Added rate limiting  
‚úó Found issue with token expiration - investigating
```

### Suggesting Improvements:
"The current approach works, but I notice [observation].
Would you like me to [specific improvement]?"

## ü§ù Working Together

- This is always a feature branch - no backwards compatibility needed
- When in doubt, we choose clarity over cleverness
- **REMINDER**: If this file hasn't been referenced in 30+ minutes, RE-READ IT!

Avoid complex abstractions or "clever" code. The simple, obvious solution is probably better, and my guidance helps you stay focused on what matters.

## üîÆ Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis & Collaborative Debates

### üîë Gemini API Configuration
To enable Gemini CLI for debates, research, and collaborative analysis:

1. **Quick Setup** (Copy and run this):
```bash
# Set API key for current session
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyAozANaHRVEEx40lerjmRMHOem90gmC0cY"

# Add to shell profile for permanent access
echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyAozANaHRVEEx40lerjmRMHOem90gmC0cY"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

2. **Alternative: Manual Setup**:
```bash
# Set for current session only
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyAozANaHRVEEx40lerjmRMHOem90gmC0cY"

# Or add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile manually
```

3. **Verify configuration**:
```bash
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Should display your key
gemini --version      # Should work without errors

# Test with a simple query
gemini -y -p "Hello, are you working?"
```

4. **Security Note**: 
- This API key is now stored in CLAUDE.md for reference
- For production environments, use environment variables or secure key management
- Rotate keys periodically for security

### ü§ñ Using Gemini for AI Debates & Research

When you need a second opinion, want to explore alternatives, or debate complex decisions, use Gemini as your thinking partner:

#### **Collaborative Problem-Solving**:
```bash
# Debate architectural decisions
gemini -y -p "I'm considering microservices vs monolith for a payment system. 
Current requirements: @requirements.md @current-architecture.md
Let's debate the pros and cons for this specific use case."

# Research best practices with context
gemini -y -p "@src/ What are the security vulnerabilities in this codebase? 
Let's discuss remediation strategies prioritized by risk."
```

#### **Code Review Debates**:
```bash
# Get alternative perspectives on implementation
gemini -y -p "@src/auth.js @tests/auth.test.js 
Review this authentication implementation. What alternative approaches would be more secure or maintainable?"

# Challenge your assumptions
gemini -y -p "@api/ @database/schema.sql 
I think this API design is RESTful. Challenge my design decisions and suggest improvements."
```

#### **Research Complex Issues**:
```bash
# Investigate performance problems
gemini -y -p "@logs/performance.log @src/api/ 
These endpoints are slow. Let's analyze potential causes and debate optimization strategies."

# Explore multiple solutions
gemini -y -p "@error-logs/ @src/payment/ 
We're getting intermittent payment failures. Let's brainstorm possible causes and solutions."
```

### üéØ Strategic Use Cases for Gemini

1. **When Claude's context is limited**: Use Gemini for analyzing entire codebases
2. **For second opinions**: Get alternative perspectives on complex decisions
3. **Debate mode**: Challenge assumptions and explore trade-offs
4. **Research mode**: Deep dive into best practices and patterns
5. **Validation**: Verify Claude's suggestions with another AI perspective

### File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
  gemini command:

#### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
```bash
gemini -y -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"
```

**Multiple files:**
```bash
gemini -y -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"
```

**Entire directory:**
```bash
gemini -y -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"
```

**Multiple directories:**
```bash
gemini -y -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"
```

**Current directory and subdirectories:**
```bash
gemini -y -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini -y --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"
```

### Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results

### ü§ù Gemini Integration with Agent Workflow

When working with specialized agents, use Gemini to enhance decision-making:

```bash
# After business-analyst creates PRD
gemini -y -p "@PRD.md @objective.md 
What critical requirements might be missing? What edge cases should we consider?"

# Challenge security-specialist findings
gemini -y -p "@security-audit.md @src/ 
Are there additional security vulnerabilities not mentioned? Let's debate the risk priorities."

# Validate architectural decisions
gemini -y -p "@TSD.md @infrastructure/ 
Review this technical specification. What alternative architectures could better serve our needs?"

# Research best practices for implementation
gemini -y -p "@requirements/ What are the latest best practices for implementing this feature in 2024?"
```

### üß† Gemini as Your Debate Partner

Use Gemini to challenge your thinking at key decision points:

1. **Before Implementation**: "Is this the right approach?"
2. **During Code Review**: "What am I missing?"
3. **When Stuck**: "What alternatives exist?"
4. **After Completion**: "How could this be better?"

Example debate prompts:
```bash
# Challenge your approach
gemini -y -p "@my-solution.js I solved X with approach Y. 
Critique my solution and suggest better alternatives."

# Explore trade-offs
gemini -y -p "@option1/ @option2/ 
Compare these two implementations. Which better balances performance, maintainability, and security?"

# Get unstuck
gemini -y -p "@current-code.js @error-log.txt 
I'm stuck on this bug. Let's brainstorm potential causes and solutions."
```

### üîÑ Automatic Gemini Debate Triggers

**IMPORTANT**: Claude should PROACTIVELY use Gemini when these triggers appear:

#### **Decision Keywords** (Auto-debate):
- "Should I use X or Y?" ‚Üí Debate both options
- "Is this the right approach?" ‚Üí Challenge current solution
- "What's better, A or B?" ‚Üí Compare trade-offs
- "I'm thinking of..." ‚Üí Validate the approach
- "I'm considering..." ‚Üí Explore alternatives

#### **Action Keywords** (Immediate Gemini consultation):

Claude: *Automatically runs*: gemini -y -p "Validate JWT authentication approach. What are the security considerations and alternatives?"

User: "Debate microservices for our payment system"
Claude: *Automatically runs*: gemini -y -p "@current-architecture/ Should we use microservices for a payment system? Analyze security, complexity, and reliability trade-offs."

User: "I'm stuck on this caching bug"
Claude: *Automatically runs*: gemini -y -p "@cache-code.js @error.log Help debug this caching issue and suggest solutions."
```

#### **Response Format**:
When triggered, Claude will:
1. Acknowledge the trigger: "Let me get Gemini's perspective on this..."
2. Run the appropriate Gemini command
3. Present Gemini's analysis
4. Add Claude's own thoughts
5. Synthesize both perspectives for a balanced view

### GEMINI MODELS
We only use the following Gemini Models:
- gemini-2.5-flash (Fast analysis, good for quick debates)
- gemini-2.5-pro (Deep analysis, best for complex architectural decisions)

Older models such as gemini-1.5-flash don't exist anymore.

### üöÄ Quick Gemini Commands

```bash
# Quick code review
gemini -y -p "@. Review this codebase for security issues and best practices"

# Architecture analysis
gemini -y -p "@src/ @docs/ Analyze the architecture and suggest improvements"

# Debug assistance
gemini -y -p "@error.log @relevant-code/ Help me debug this issue"

# Performance optimization

## üèóÔ∏è Common Architectural Patterns

### 1. Webhook-Driven Architecture
Most projects follow this pattern:
```
External Service ‚Üí Webhook Endpoint ‚Üí Event Processor ‚Üí Service Layer ‚Üí Action/Notification
                         ‚Üì
                  HMAC Verification
```

### 2. Service-Oriented Architecture
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/      # API endpoints and webhook handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/    # Business logic and external integrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/      # Data models (Mongoose/Prisma)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/       # Shared utilities and helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/      # Configuration management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/  # Express middleware (auth, validation)
```

### 3. Multi-Phase Implementation Pattern
