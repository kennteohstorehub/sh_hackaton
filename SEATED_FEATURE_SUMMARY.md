# âœ… Seated Notification Feature - Implementation Complete

## Server Status
- **Running**: Yes, on port 3838
- **Health Check**: OK
- **URL**: http://localhost:3838

## Feature Implementation

### What Was Added
When a merchant assigns a table to a customer, the system now:

1. **Sends a seated notification** to the customer's WebChat
2. **Displays the table number** (e.g., "You have been seated at table 5")
3. **Closes the WebChat session** transparently
4. **Prevents further messages** from being sent

### Code Changes

#### Server-Side (`/server/routes/queue.js`)
- Added customer notification emission after table assignment (line 688-714)
- Emits `customer-seated-notification` event to customer rooms
- Clears WebChat session using `webChatService.clearSession()`

#### Client-Side (`/public/js/queue-chat.js`)
- Added event listener for `customer-seated-notification` (line 179)
- Implemented `handleCustomerSeated()` method (lines 1732-1798)
- Shows seated message with table number
- Updates UI to "Session Ended" status
- Disables input and hides quick actions
- Disconnects WebSocket after 2 seconds

### How to Test

1. **Merchant Login**: http://localhost:3838/auth/login
   - Email: `demo@storehub.com`
   - Password: `demo123`

2. **Customer WebChat**: http://localhost:3838/chat/[merchantId]
   - Join queue with test details
   - Wait for merchant to call
   - Acknowledge when called
   - Watch for seated notification when merchant assigns table

### Expected Result
When merchant assigns a table, customer sees:
```
ðŸŽ‰ You have been seated at table 5. Thank you for using our queue system!

[2 seconds later]
This chat session is now closed. We hope you enjoy your visit!
```

Then:
- Connection status shows "Session Ended"
- Input field is disabled
- Quick actions disappear
- WebSocket disconnects

## Verification
Run `node verify-seated-feature.js` to confirm all components are implemented correctly.
