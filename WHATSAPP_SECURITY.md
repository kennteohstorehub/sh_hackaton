# WhatsApp Security & Testing Guidelines

## 🔒 Security Overview

The StoreHub Queue Management System includes robust security features to prevent accidental WhatsApp messages to unauthorized phone numbers during testing and development.

## 🛡️ Phone Number Whitelist

### How It Works
- **Whitelist Enforcement**: Only pre-approved phone numbers can receive WhatsApp messages
- **Automatic Blocking**: Any attempt to send messages to non-whitelisted numbers is blocked
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All blocked attempts are logged for security monitoring
- **Environment-Aware**: Automatically enabled in development, configurable for production

### Current Whitelist
Your phone number `60126368832` is already whitelisted in multiple formats:
- `60126368832` (Malaysian format)
- `+60126368832` (International format)
- `126368832` (Without country code)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Check Current Security Status
```bash
node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js status
```

### Test a Phone Number
```bash
# Test if a number is allowed
node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js test 60126368832
node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js test +60987654321
```

### Add a New Number to Whitelist
```bash
# Add your secondary number (if you have one)
node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js add 60123456789
```

### Run Security Tests
```bash
# Comprehensive security test
node test-whatsapp-security.js
```

## 📋 Security Features

### ✅ What's Protected
- **Message Sending**: All `sendMessage()` calls are filtered through the whitelist
- **Queue Notifications**: Customer notifications are blocked for unauthorized numbers
- **Test Scripts**: All testing scripts respect the whitelist
- **API Endpoints**: WhatsApp API endpoints enforce the whitelist

### ✅ What's Allowed
- **Your Number**: `60126368832` and its variants
- **Authorized Testing**: Only whitelisted numbers receive messages
- **Development Safety**: No accidental messages to random numbers
- **Production Override**: Whitelist can be disabled in production if needed

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable/disable whitelist (default: enabled in development)
WHATSAPP_ENFORCE_WHITELIST=true

# Add numbers via environment (comma-separated)
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS=60126368832,+60126368832,60123456789
```

### Configuration File
Edit `server/config/whatsapp-security.js` to modify the whitelist:

```javascript
const ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS = [
  '60126368832',    // Your primary number
  '+60126368832',   // Your primary number with + prefix
  '126368832',      // Your number without country code
  // Add more numbers here as needed
];
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Before Testing WhatsApp Features:
1. **Verify Whitelist**: Run `node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js status`
2. **Test Security**: Run `node test-whatsapp-security.js`
3. **Confirm Your Number**: Ensure your number is in the whitelist

### Safe Testing Practices:
- ✅ Always check whitelist status before testing
- ✅ Use the management script to add new numbers
- ✅ Run security tests after configuration changes
- ❌ Never disable the whitelist unless in production
- ❌ Never add random or test numbers to the whitelist

## 🚨 Security Alerts

### Blocked Message Attempts
When a message to an unauthorized number is blocked, you'll see:

```
🚫 SECURITY BLOCK: Message to 1234567890 was blocked by whitelist
🔒 Only these numbers are allowed: 60126368832, +60126368832, 126368832
```

### Log Monitoring
All security events are logged with the `storehub-queue-management-system` logger:
- ✅ Successful message sends to whitelisted numbers
- 🚫 Blocked attempts to unauthorized numbers
- 📱 Whitelist modifications

## 🔄 Production Deployment

### For Production Use:
1. **Option 1 - Keep Whitelist**: Add all legitimate customer numbers
2. **Option 2 - Disable Whitelist**: Set `WHATSAPP_ENFORCE_WHITELIST=false`

### Recommended Production Setup:
```bash
# .env for production
NODE_ENV=production
WHATSAPP_ENFORCE_WHITELIST=false  # Disable for production
```

## 📞 Emergency Procedures

### If You Need to Add a Number Quickly:
```bash
# Add immediately
node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js add +60987654321

# Verify it was added
node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js test +60987654321
```

### If Messages Are Being Blocked Unexpectedly:
1. Check whitelist status: `node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js status`
2. Verify number format: `node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js test YOUR_NUMBER`
3. Add the number if needed: `node manage-whatsapp-whitelist.js add YOUR_NUMBER`
