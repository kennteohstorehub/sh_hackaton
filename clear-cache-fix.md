# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Browser Cache Issue

The fixes have been applied to the code, but your browser is using the CACHED version of queue-chat.js!

## Immediate Solution:

### Option 1: Force Refresh (Recommended)
1. Open the chat page
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
3. This forces the browser to download fresh files

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Add Cache Busting
Add a version parameter to the script tag in queue-chat.ejs:
```html
<script src="/js/queue-chat.js?v=<%= Date.now() %>"></script>
```

## Verification:
After clearing cache, check that:
1. No more "Cannot read properties of null" errors
2. Welcome messages appear
3. Verification code displays
4. Notifications work

## Why This Happened:
- The JavaScript file was fixed on the server
- But browsers cache JS files aggressively
- The old buggy version is still being used
- This is why the line numbers don't match the current code

## Prevention:
We should implement cache busting in production to prevent this issue.
