# Authentication System E2E Test Report

## Executive Summary

A critical redirect loop exists in the authentication system that prevents users from accessing the login page when authentication is required. This is caused by a configuration mismatch between route handling and authentication middleware.

## Test Environment

- **URL**: http://localhost:3838
- **Configuration**:
  - `USE_AUTH_BYPASS=false` (authentication required)
  - `NODE_ENV` not set (defaults to development)
  - PostgreSQL session store active
  - Session cookie: `saveUninitialized: false`

## Issue #1: Infinite Redirect Loop

### Description
When attempting to access any protected route, the system enters an infinite redirect loop between `/auth/login` and `/dashboard`.

### Evidence
```
REDIRECT: http://localhost:3838/dashboard -> /auth/login?redirect=%2Fdashboard
REDIRECT: http://localhost:3838/auth/login?redirect=%2Fdashboard -> /dashboard
REDIRECT: http://localhost:3838/dashboard -> /auth/login?redirect=%2Fdashboard
REDIRECT: http://localhost:3838/auth/login?redirect=%2Fdashboard -> /dashboard
... (infinite loop continues)
```

### Root Cause
In `server/index.js` (lines 289-293):
```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  app.use('/auth', require('./routes/frontend/auth-redirect'));
} else {
  app.use('/auth', require('./routes/frontend/auth'));
}
```

**The Problem**:
1. When `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, the `auth-redirect.js` routes are loaded
2. `auth-redirect.js` makes `/auth/login` redirect to `/dashboard`
3. But `USE_AUTH_BYPASS=false` means real authentication is required
4. The `requireAuth` middleware on `/dashboard` redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/login`
5. This creates an infinite loop

### Impact
- Users cannot access the login page
- Users cannot authenticate
- The application is completely unusable when authentication is required

## Issue #2: Configuration Mismatch

### Description
The route selection logic uses `NODE_ENV` while the middleware selection uses `USE_AUTH_BYPASS`, creating inconsistent behavior.

### Current Behavior
- **Routes**: Selected based on `NODE_ENV`
- **Middleware**: Selected based on `USE_AUTH_BYPASS`
- **Result**: Routes and middleware can be mismatched

### Expected Behavior
Both routes and middleware should be selected based on the same configuration variable.

## Issue #3: Session Management

### Observations
- Session cookies are created on each request
- CSRF tokens are properly generated
- Session store (PostgreSQL) is functioning
- However, the redirect loop prevents proper session establishment

## Issue #4: Protected Route Behavior

### Test Results
- `/dashboard` - Returns 401 (via API) or redirects to `/auth/login` (via browser)
- `/auth/login` - Redirects to `/dashboard` (causing the loop)
- `/auth/logout` - Functions correctly, destroys session
- API endpoints - Correctly return 401 for unauthenticated requests

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
Update `server/index.js` to use `USE_AUTH_BYPASS` for route selection:

```javascript
// Use appropriate auth routes based on auth bypass setting
const useAuthBypass = process.env.USE_AUTH_BYPASS === 'true';
if (useAuthBypass) {
  app.use('/auth', require('./routes/frontend/auth-redirect'));
} else {
  app.use('/auth', require('./routes/frontend/auth'));
}
```

### Why This Works
- When `USE_AUTH_BYPASS=true`: Both routes and middleware bypass authentication
- When `USE_AUTH_BYPASS=false`: Both routes and middleware require authentication
- This ensures consistent behavior throughout the application

## Additional Findings

### 1. CSRF Protection
- CSRF tokens are properly generated and stored in cookies
- Tokens are included in response headers
- Forms would need to include the token for POST requests

### 2. Logout Functionality
- Logout endpoint works correctly
- Session is properly destroyed
- User is redirected to home page

### 3. Concurrent Sessions
- Each browser context receives a unique session
- Sessions are properly isolated
- No session collision detected

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Apply the fix to `server/index.js` to resolve the redirect loop
2. **Short-term**: Add integration tests to prevent similar configuration mismatches
3. **Long-term**: Consider consolidating auth configuration into a single source of truth

## Test Execution Details

- **Test Framework**: Playwright, Puppeteer, and manual curl/axios tests
- **Browsers Tested**: Chromium (via Playwright)
- **Total Redirects Captured**: 20+ (loop detected and terminated)
- **Test Duration**: Multiple test runs over 10 minutes

## Conclusion

The authentication system has a critical configuration issue that makes it unusable when authentication is required. The fix is straightforward and involves aligning the route selection logic with the middleware selection logic. Once fixed, the authentication system should function as designed.
