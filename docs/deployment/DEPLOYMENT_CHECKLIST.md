## Render Deployment Steps

1. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Since auto-deploy is enabled, Render will automatically deploy from the latest push
   - Monitor the deployment at: https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Manual Verification Required**
   - Ensure DATABASE_URL is set (Neon pooled connection)
   - Ensure DATABASE_URL_DIRECT is set (Neon direct connection)
   - Verify JWT_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET are generated

3. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test health endpoint
   curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health
   
   # Test webchat join
   curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/webchat/join \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "customerName": "Test User",
       "customerPhone": "+60123456789",
       "partySize": 2,
       "merchantId": "YOUR_MERCHANT_ID",
       "sessionId": "test_session_123"
     }'
   ```

## Key Features Now Available

1. **WebSocket Notifications**
   - Customers receive real-time updates via WebSocket
   - No WhatsApp dependency required
   - Session-based notification routing

2. **Environment Control**
   - `ENABLE_WHATSAPP_WEB=false` disables WhatsApp completely
   - Falls back to WebSocket and push notifications

3. **Database Compatibility**
   - Full Prisma ORM integration
   - MongoDB models removed
   - Automatic migrations on deploy

## Monitoring

- Check Render logs for any deployment issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous commit: `git revert HEAD && git push`
2. Or manually redeploy previous version in Render dashboard
