# PWA Push Notifications Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Progressive Web App (PWA) push notifications as a free alternative to SMS for notifying customers when their table is ready.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Service Worker (`public/sw.js`)
- Handles push notification events
- Manages notification clicks and actions
- Implements background sync capabilities
- Shows rich notifications with action buttons

### 2. Push Notification Service (`server/services/pushNotificationService.js`)
- Manages VAPID key generation and storage
- Saves push subscriptions to PostgreSQL database
- Sends various notification types:
  - Table ready notifications
  - Position update notifications
  - Queue joined confirmations
- Handles subscription cleanup for expired endpoints

### 3. API Endpoints (`server/routes/push.js`)
- `GET /api/push/vapid-public-key` - Provides public key for client subscription
- `POST /api/push/subscribe` - Saves push subscription for a queue entry
- `POST /api/push/test` - Test endpoint for sending notifications

### 4. Database Schema Updates
- Added `PushSubscription` model to Prisma schema
- Created migration/setup script for production database
- Stores subscription endpoint, keys, and expiration data

### 5. Frontend Integration (`public/join.html`)
- Requests notification permission on page load
- Registers service worker automatically
- Subscribes to push notifications when joining queue
- Shows appropriate success messages based on notification status

### 6. Queue System Integration
- Push notifications added to:
  - Customer calling (both next and specific)
  - Position updates when others are served
  - Queue joining confirmation
- Fallback to WhatsApp when push fails
- Dual notification strategy for maximum reach

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:
```
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BMWL4xHzsWAUxQ7YTm_gYFqAuyUVhG7dBpGf20XIZGsvrSjXEZXDk7szGaOlKqCUXm_6h-5H20Ht0AFKBqYFezk
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=suhY0EZr66qaEv6lW-fltiYXYM7qs8mYMOSr1IDM1x4
```

### Database Setup
Run this command to create the push subscription table:
```bash
node setup-push-notifications.js
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/join.html?merchantId=YOUR_MERCHANT_ID`
2. Allow notifications when prompted
3. Fill out the form and join the queue
4. Call the customer from the dashboard to trigger a notification

### Test Tool
Use the provided test tool:
```bash
node test-push-notifications.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Received
1. Check browser notification permissions
2. Ensure HTTPS in production (required for service workers)
3. Verify VAPID keys are correctly set
4. Check browser console for errors

### Database Errors
1. Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes
2. Ensure PushSubscription table exists
3. Check database connection string

### Service Worker Issues
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check service worker registration in DevTools
3. Ensure sw.js is served from root path
