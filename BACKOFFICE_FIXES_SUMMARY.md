# BackOffice System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Logout Button Visibility
- **Issue**: Logout button was not visible in the sidebar
- **Fix**: Enhanced CSS styling with gradient background, better contrast, and hover effects
- **File**: `/views/backoffice/layout.ejs`

### 2. ✅ Merchants Route 500 Error
- **Issue**: HTTP 500 error when accessing merchant pages due to schema mismatches
- **Root Cause**: Routes were using non-existent fields (`name` instead of `businessName`, `ownerEmail` instead of `email`)
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Updated all queries in `/server/routes/backoffice/merchants.js` to use correct field names
  - Removed references to non-existent `users` relation
  - Fixed search queries to use proper field names
  - Added null checks for tenant relationships

### 3. ✅ Merchant Views Updated
- **Files Updated**:
  - `/views/backoffice/merchants/index.ejs`: Fixed field names and removed users column
  - `/views/backoffice/merchants/show.ejs`: Fixed field names, removed users section, updated statistics

## Schema Reference

### Merchant Model Fields (from Prisma schema):
```prisma
model Merchant {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  businessName String   // NOT "name"
  email        String   @unique  // NOT "ownerEmail"
  // NO users relation exists
  // Other fields: phone, address, businessType, timezone, isActive, etc.
}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Field Name Corrections**:
   - `merchant.name` → `merchant.businessName`
   - `merchant.ownerEmail` → `merchant.email`
   - Removed all references to `merchant.users` relation

2. **Added Null Safety**:
   - Added checks for `merchant.tenant` before accessing its properties
   - Added proper error handling for missing data

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Enhanced logout button visibility with gradient background
   - Improved hover effects and contrast
   - Made button more prominent with uppercase text and shadow

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test merchant listing page: http://admin.lvh.me:3000/backoffice/merchants
2. Test individual merchant details pages
3. Verify toggle merchant status functionality
4. Test search and filtering features
5. Verify CSV export functionality
