Build Version: 2025-01-24-v7
Purpose: Fixed auth-bypass middleware for production deployment
Changes:
- Enhanced auth-bypass middleware to ensure req.user is ALWAYS set
- Fixed redirect loop issue by guaranteeing user object exists
- All middleware uses auth-bypass instead of real auth
- Demo merchant ID hardcoded: 7a99f35e-0f73-4f8e-831c-fde8fc3a5532
- CSRF: COMPLETELY DISABLED (temporary for testing)
- Moved createDemoSession to top of middleware stack

STATUS: Production-ready auth bypass for core functionality development
