4. **Total Journey Time**: Understand the complete customer experience

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Wait Time**: Time from joining to being called
- **Response Time**: Time from notification to acknowledgment
- **Service Time**: Time from arrival to completion
- **No-Show Prevention**: Identify patterns in acknowledgment behavior

### Customer Experience
- Better understanding of customer flow
- Identify areas for improvement

## Technical Implementation

### Database Fields Used
- `joinedAt` - When customer joined the queue
- `calledAt` - When customer was notified
- `acknowledgedAt` - When customer acknowledged (optional)
- `servedAt` - When customer was served (if available)
- `completedAt` - When service was completed

### Time Calculations
- **Wait Time**: `calledAt - joinedAt`
- **Total Time**: `completedAt - joinedAt`
- All times displayed in local timezone
- Durations calculated in minutes

## Testing
Use the test script to create sample completed customers:
```bash
node test-completed-table.js
```

This creates customers with various time scenarios:
- Quick service (5-minute wait)
- Long wait (40-minute wait)
- No acknowledgment scenario
- Recent completions

## Future Enhancements
- Export completed customers data to CSV
- Add filtering by date range
- Show average metrics at the bottom
- Add sorting by different columns
- Include customer feedback/ratings if available
